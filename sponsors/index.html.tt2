      <h1>Sponsors</h1>

      <p>This is a list of companies or organizations that provide ongoing support to Grml. Thanks to their support and assistance the Grml project can provide an excessive list of services for our users like free CDs, daily images (more than 16 different images), mailing lists, website, wiki etc. To be more precise without their support the <a href="/">Grml project</a> would not be able to provide all the services you know and love.</p>
