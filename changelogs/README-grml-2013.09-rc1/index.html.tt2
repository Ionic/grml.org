        <h1>Release Notes for Grml 2013.09-rc1 - codename <a
        href="/faq/#releasename">Ponywagon</a></h1>

        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>This Grml release provides fresh software packages after the
        Debian stable release (AKA wheezy) has been released. As usual it also
        incorporates up2date hardware support and fixes known bugs from the previous Grml release.</p>

        <h3>New features</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>new boot option <em>encpasswd</em>: takes a hashed password as
          argument, setting password of users root and grml to the specified
          value

        </ul>

        <h3>Important Changes</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>UTC is used as default time zone, to use a different setting
          you can use the <em>tz</em> boot option (usage example: tz=Europe/Vienna)

          <li>To match the behaviour with the <em>ssh</em> boot option the
          <em>passwd</em> boot option now also sets the password for user root -
          and not only for user 'grml'.

          <li>grml-autoconfig (and its GRMLCFG feature) doesn't support floppy
          disks any longer

        </ul>

        <h3>Bits &amp; bolts</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Linux kernel is based on <b>3.X.X</b>. No additional modules are shipped.</li>
          <li>Fixed several bugs from the <a href="http://bts.grml.org/grml/">bug tracking system</a>.</li>
        </ul>
