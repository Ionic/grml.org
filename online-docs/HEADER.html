Welcome to the grml online documentation!

This directory is automatically updated every night
using grml's mercurial repositories from
http://hg.grml.org/ and some nifty tools from
grml's hg-doc repository so you have access to
up2date documentation without the need for booting
grml or installing any packages on your system.

If you think some files should be extended, need some
bugfixes,... please let us know!
