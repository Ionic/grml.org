INSTALL:

Simply become root and download grml2hd. 
"wget http://dynamic.g-tec.co.at/grml2hd/grml2hd-0.2.1/grml2hd

Execute "chmod u+x grml2hd" to make the script executable. Now start
grml2hd as usual, but don't forget to append the correct path, otherwise
the old grml2hd script will be executed, e.g.
./grml2hd /dev/sda11

VERSION NUMBERS:

grml-0.2 release includes grml-0.1 installer. We changed the versioning
scheme, so that the first digits are now the same as the release number
of the grml-CD. This means: grml2hd-0.2.x updates are only for grml-0.2
CDs, grml2hd-0.3.x are for grml-0.3, and so on.

Enjoy, Jimmy
