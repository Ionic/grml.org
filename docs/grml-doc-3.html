</H2>

<H3>introduction</H3>

<P>The default shell of grml is the zsh. You'll find a preconfigured zsh.
Main configuration of zsh is located in /etc/zsh/. This documentation
covers current version of zsh (>=4.2).</P>

<H3>completition system</H3>

<P>You'll get a zsh with the completition mechanism. grml system loads the
completion mechanism by default:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
autoload -U compinit &amp;&amp; compinit
zmodload -i zsh/complist
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now it is possible to use the powerful completition mechanism of zsh.
For example file completition is something you might know from other shells:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
mika@grml /tmp/mplayer-1.0-pre4 % vim debian/cont&lt;press tab>
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>But zsh can provide completition also by detecting the context:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
mika@grml ~ % ssh grml@&lt;press tab>
completing host
grml       localhost
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>And it's possible to extend and adjust the completition mechanism.
Take a look at the Makefile-completition:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
mika@grml /tmp/mplayer-1.0-pre4 % debian/rules &lt;press tab>
completing make target
binary           binary-indep     build-stamp      configure        install          patch-stamp
binary-arch      build            clean            configure-stamp  patch            unpatch
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following listing is the output provided by running 'bindkey' on zsh
configuration on the grml system. Notice that the sequence '^[' in bindkey
commands refers to the escape key.  '^' refers to the control key.  '^A' is
the short form for ctrl-a. Take a closer look at it because using
keybindings for special task is a very important step to become a poweruser
on the command line.</P>

<P>zsh supports many options (see 'man 1 zshoptions' for more details).
To get the current settings run the command 'setopt' without any options.
On the grml system you'll find the following options set:</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>append_history</B><DD><P>If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history
list to the history file, rather than overwrite it. Thus, multiple parallel
zsh sessions will all have their history lists added to the history file,
in the order they are killed.</P>

<DT><B>autocd</B><DD><P>If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal
command, and the command is the name of a directory, perform the cd command
to that directory.</P>

<DT><B>noclobber</B><DD><P>Does not allow `>' redirection to truncate existing files,
and `>>' to create files. You must use `>!' or `>|' to truncate a file, and
`>>!' or `>>|' to create a file. This options is prevents files from being
deleted by accident.</P>

<DT><B>correct</B><DD><P>Try to correct the spelling of commands. Note that, when the
HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when some directories in the path are
not readable, this may falsely report spelling errors the first time some
commands are used.</P>

<DT><B>extendedglob</B><DD><P>Treat the `#', `&nbsp;' and `^' characters as part of
patterns for filename generation, etc. (An initial unquoted `&nbsp;' always
produces named directory expansion.)</P>

<DT><B>extendedhistory</B><DD><P>Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds
since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the history file.</P>

<DT><B>hash_list_all</B><DD><P>Whenever a command completion is attempted, make sure
the entire command path is hashed first. This makes the first completion
slower.</P>

<DT><B>histallowclobber</B><DD><P>Add `|' to output redirections in the history. This
allows history references to clobber files even when CLOBBER is unset.</P>

<DT><B>histignorealldups</B><DD><P>If a new command line being added to the history
list duplicates an older one, the older command is removed from the list
(even if it is not the previous event).</P>

<DT><B>histignorespace</B><DD><P>Remove command lines from the history list when the
first character on the line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases
contains a leading space. Note that the command lingers in the internal
history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you
to briefly reuse or edit the line. If you want to make it vanish right away
without entering another command, type a space and press return.</P>

<DT><B>interactive</B><DD><P>This is an interactive shell. This option is set upon
initialisation if the standard input is a tty and commands are being read
from standard input. (See the discussion of SHIN_STDIN.) This heuristic may
be overridden by specifying a state for this option on the command line.
The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other than the command
line.</P>

<DT><B>monitor</B><DD><P>Allow job control. Set by default in interactive shells.</P>

<DT><B>notify</B><DD><P>Report the status of background jobs immediately, rather than
waiting until just before printing a prompt.</P>

<DT><B>promptsubst</B><DD><P>If set, parameter expansion, command substitution and
arithmetic expansion are performed in prompts. Substitutions within prompts
do not affect the command status.</P>

<DT><B>norcs</B><DD><P>After /etc/zshenv is sourced on startup, source the .zshenv,
/etc/zprofile, .zprofile, /etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin, .zlogin, and
.zlogout files, as described in the section `Files'. If this option is
unset, the /etc/zshenv file is still sourced, but any of the others will
not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the remaining startup files
after the currently executing one from being sourced.</P>

<DT><B>sharehistory</B><DD><P>This option both imports new commands from the history
file, and also causes your typed commands to be appended to the history
file. If you find that you want more control over when commands get
imported, you may wish to turn SHARE_HISTORY off, INC_APPEND_HISTORY on,
and then manually import commands whenever you need them using `fc -RI'.</P>

<DT><B>shinstdin</B><DD><P>Commands are being read from the standard input. Commands
are read from standard input if no command is specified with -c and no file
of commands is specified. If SHIN_STDIN is set explicitly on the command
line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a file to run
will instead be treated as a normal positional parameter. Note that setting
or unsetting this option on the command line does not necessarily affect
the state the option will have while the shell is running - that is purely
an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being read from
standard input. The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other
than the command line.</P>

<DT><B>zle</B><DD><P>Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in interactive shells
connected to a terminal.</P>
